## The Intergalactic Railway

> *A mysterious secret location*

A mysterious railway that has about ten stations floating in empty space, away from the civilised planets. Each has a platform, and an office, and about 1000m of track with two wormholes at each end.

### Properties
- Completely unexplored - no one knows about them
- There are some books on them in the federal libraries
- They constantly change position
- Occasionally huge quantum freight trains hurtle through
- They occasionally have **ULTRA RARE** items
- They have gravity, for some unknown reason

### The Main Station
The biggest station is different to the others:
- Located in the Warp Gulf
- Does not move

### Exploration
- If you walk out into the wormholes, you might come to another station, or come to a huge expanse of track in a random part of the universe
- There are quantum ghosts surrounding some parts of the train station
- Occasionally you will see "Wanderers" - random people or even unknown aliens that sit at the train station or get off the quantum freight trains
