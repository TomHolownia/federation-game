## The Golden Era (2110-2200)

The golden era of the Federation. Democracy reigns, trade and relations between the 4 civilizations prosper. Remaining known planets discovered. Human culture saturates the Federation, as Chiascurans want more of their beautiful music and art.

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2110** | Federal council sits for the first time in the Marrakech chambers. Human tensions are eased significantly. |
| **2112** | Kynias Station completely finished. |
| **2115** | Many Chiascurans learn the Human English language, as it is very easy for them to pick up, much to the dislike of the Zaggnor. |
| **2130** | The Imperial Navy have become a skeleton force spread through the galaxy, as the Federation believe they are completely safe in the universe. |
| **2134** | The Chinese party leads a rebellion on Korg, claiming humans should become their own independent state. |
| **2135** | Chinese rebellion quashed by the weak Navy. Many human officials not only killed, but executed by local Navy personnel sick of the Korg Humans. |
| **2135** | Navy condemned for actions on Korg, but human uprising stops as the brutality of the Navy is realized. |
| **2136** | Sanctions for the Navy include reduced funding and penalties for higher ups over the incident on Korg. Mostly done to appease human disquiet, but in reality, weakens the Navy. |
| **2140** | Jallagar and Relum open fourth Kynias wormhole to New Mars, as a sign of trust to the Humans. They also declare the official language of Kynias Station as English. |
| **2150-80** | The first Intergalactic Human explorer, the famous captain **Jack Sullivan**, discovers Parraxium, Angelus and Altmara. Whilst on Altmara his ship came under fire from a Pryzct scout warship, and was forced to flee. It then "stumbled" upon Jack's Salvation as he had to land to repair his ship. |
| **2160** | Human language spreads through the Federation, as Chiascurans find the tongue extremely easy to pick up. The majority of Zaggnor resent this, and use translating technology rather than learning the language. |
| **2170** | New Mars booms as it becomes a huge supplier of goods and power to the Federation, only matched by Callarando. |
| **2190** | Jack returns to Magnus with footage and tales of the Pryzct ship and his narrow escape. The Navy get a warship to investigate, but nothing is found, and no more is done. |
| **2190** | **President Allgar**, the first Zaggnor President is elected, to the discontent of huge amounts of human voters. However, Allgar has learnt English, and wishes to promote Human-Zaggnor relations. |
| **2195** | Chiascuran scientists work with the Hellir to create "immortality" nano bots, which correct cell reproduction. These nano bots are extremely expensive to make, and must be tailored to the individual. Such individuals with these nano bots are known as "**Biotics**," and are only really available to the wealthiest 0.01% of the Federation. |

## The New Mars Uprising (2203-2220)

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2203** | Under the lazy eye of the Federation parliament, conditions on New Mars were allowed to become unbearable. Contempt for the Federation builds further. The deadly ruler, **James Milligan**, forces the population into slavery. Uses anti-Federation propaganda to justify his actions. In secret he has built up his empire; he declares control over New Mars. |
| **2204** | The Imperial Navy is tasked with overcoming James' forces. They are met with fierce fighting; losses are extremely high for the Navy, as the Forces of New Mars are somehow equipped with extremely powerful weaponry. James spreads fearful propaganda and indoctrinates the population into a pseudo-religious cult bent on the downfall of the Federation. |
| **2204** | Terrorist splinter cells based around the Federation bomb buildings and kill civilians. Hundreds of attacks occur on Kynias, Marrakech, Callarando, Nexus 32, Crypton, Gorgon and Marraxis. |
| **2205** | The Federal Council declares the New Mars situation a Federal emergency, and allocates huge amounts of funds to the Navy. |
| **2207** | A huge assault is launched on New Mars by the Navy, but is repelled with heavy losses on both sides. Again, the superior technology of New Mars wins out. |
| **2210** | New Mars forces defeat the Navy in space, and push out to capture Korg and Earth. |
| **2210-15** | Fierce fighting between the Navy and local police forces against James' soldiers on Korg, Earth and New Mars. Huge portions of land on all three planets is lost to nuclear explosions. |
| **2213** | The Federal Parliament makes a secret deal with **DarkTech** to employ them in developing weaponry for the Navy and to hire assassins. The Federation Parliament realizes they need to invest more money in military ventures. |
| **2215** | James Milligan, drunk on power, orders his forces to attack Marrakech directly. A fierce battle over the skies of Marrakech ensues, but James's forces are pushed back. DarkTech assassins slip past James' perimeter and kill him, removing his head. Most of James' top lieutenants on New Mars are killed by DarkTech assassins as well. The rebellion is quashed as the chain of command collapses and the Imperial Navy moves in. |
| **2218** | Peace finally restored to Korg, New Mars and Earth. Most of James's subjects fled to Korg where they formed gangs, including the **Jaded Suns**, many of which are still active today. |
| **2219** | The Federation ends their deal with DarkTech, much to the disgust of the company. DarkTech posts an irrefutable image of James Milligan's head on GalaxyNet with the caption "This is how the Federation deals with its enemies." |
| **2220** | Due to the DarkTech controversy and the killing of James and his officials, President Allgar resigns. |
| **2221** | **Allan Berring** becomes the first human to be part of a party in power, under President Zaltar Corum, a Chiascura from Gold Haven. This does much for Human-Federation relations. |
| **2225** | Despite the New Mars incident, English continues to prosper. In the 2225 census more than 50% of all people in the Federation speak it. |

---

## Post-Uprising Period

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2232** | Galaxy Class Cruiser initiative starts, to give power to the Navy once more. **Vigilant** construction begins. |
| **2232** | **Termino** discovered by ex-Milligan devotionists, becomes a hub of pirate activity. Raids carried out on space ships and stations around Siberius, Earth, New Mars, Korg, Callarando and Callamaran. |
| **2240** | After the New Mars incident, human revolution has basically stopped. The majority of humans become well-behaved imperial citizens. |
| **2280** | Altmara is swarmed by the Pryzct. The scientists that escape are, like Jack before them, not believed. |

---

## The Pryzct War (2282-Present)

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2282** | Jack's Salvation invaded by the Pryzct. Panic in the Federation. All efforts switch to the Imperial Navy as it tries to produce a force to contend with the Pryzct onslaught. |
| **2282-2290** | Pryzct incursion forces arrive to scout and attack many planets on the forefront of the battle lines. Magnus, Angelus, Parraxium, Dimitrius, Marraxis, Idomeneo and Luminel are all targeted. New Hellir is left mysteriously untouched. Rigel-7 has barely any human presence, is too close to its star, and is heavily stealthed, so is undetected by the Pryzct. |
| **2283** | **Parraxium is attacked** and completely overwhelmed, the planet's population slaughtered. A few ships escaped; the tiny military presence could not protect the civilians. |
| **2285** | Jack's Salvation becomes a hub of Pryzct control. The great alien force overruns both Dimitrius and Angelus in a two-pronged attack after months of heavy fighting. |
| **2286** | **Poseidon** arrives at Dimitrius with a huge amount of the Imperial Navy, but are driven back after days of fighting and heavy losses. Poseidon was only mildly damaged, but the rest of the Navy was ripped to shreds by a huge Pryzct counter. |
| **2288** | Efforts to retake Dimitrius intensify. Month-long bombardments of the planet and heavy fighting in the skies have almost no effect on the Pryzct forces. |
| **2289** | Navy tries to take Angelus but is crushed and driven back, as a huge Pryzct force arrives from Altmara hours after the attempt begins. |
| **2290** | Federation rattled as a huge Pryzct wormhole opens over the skies of Marraxis. The Navy scrambles to respond as ground fighting breaks out in the cities, whilst orbital bombardments cut down Imperial bases. Navy shocked that Pryzct could venture so deep into the Federation. |
| **2291** | After withdrawing almost all Naval forces from Angelus and Dimitrius to help fight, the wormhole over Marraxis is closed, and the Pryzct finally defeated and driven back. Victory largely accredited to **Jallamar Reich**, the Zaggnor commander of the 'Vigilant.' |
| **2292** | In a lightning strike, the Vigilant, Poseidon and Forsaken strike Angelus along with 45,000 Navy fighters, 3,000,000 personnel and 12,000,000 fighting bots in the biggest offensive ever committed. Hundreds of cloaked Imperial Assassins manage to infiltrate Pryzct hives, destroy 7 Pryzct queens, and decimate kilometers of valuable Pryzct infrastructure as their suits ignited in fusion blasts. This sowed disarray in the Pryzct lines, and the Navy struck. |
| **2294** | After two years of fighting the Pryzct finally relinquish Angelus, and fall back to Altmara and Jack's Salvation. |
| **2296** | Two years of espionage and small incursions pass, but the military still lacks the strength to take the fight further. Foothold on Angelus consolidated with bunkers and military infrastructure. |
| **2297** | Angelus attacked in what will be the most lasting conflict of the war. Thirty huge wormholes open, divulging millions of fighters and warships. The planet is bombarded with Pryzct spore pods, and they start to claim back Angelus. |
| **2297-2299** | The Pryzct take numerous small asteroids, planetoids and space stations in the Parraxium, Angelus, Magnus and Dimitrius regions. Trillions of Pryzct fighters advance from seemingly out of nowhere. |
| **2299** | The conflict on Angelus rages, with both sides fiercely clinging to the planet's remaining infrastructure. The surface of the world becomes more and more barren and destroyed. |

## Notes

### Origin of the Races
All of the three main races (Humans, Chiascura, Zaggnor) were seeded from the same planet being obliterated which already had the seeds of life on it. Hence the similar timelines. The Hellir are from another galaxy and timeline altogether.

### Items to Add
- The RH Union origin needs to go somewhere in the timeline
- The discovery of life-extending technology needs to go in around 2150
