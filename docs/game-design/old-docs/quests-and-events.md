## Generic Storylines (Any Race)

### 1. Crypton Opening

You see a rocket pod floating in orbit of a desert planet, slowly picking up speed and entering the atmosphere. It smashes into a junkyard on the outskirts of a huge city. Several hours later, a mob of outskirts gangsters break it open and find you asleep.

**Gameplay:**
- You wake as gangsters circle you (5 of them)
- One grabs your shoulder - you break his hand and fling him over his shoulder into another
- Three remaining activate force fields and pull out plasma weapons
- Sirens can be heard, one shoots you in the chest

**Player Choice:**
1. **Run from the cops** (not too hard) - start gathering clues
2. **Wait** - police direct you to a nearby shelter for homeless, then start your journey

### 2. Illreine-2 Opening

You wake up in a hospital with no memory. You try to get out of bed but can't. You drift back to sleep. Later you wake on the operating table - they've sedated you wrongly and you're awake. The doctor brings a saw closer to your arm...

**Gameplay:**
- Grab the saw and put it to the doctor's neck
- Walk through security, get a gun from a guard you threaten

**Player Choice:**
1. **Give yourself up** - submitted to mind tests then released into public
2. **Escape the hospital** - find a vehicle and get away. A man follows you; the first time you sleep, he'll be there when you wake.

Both paths: recurring visions throughout the game.

2. **Live out the prison sentence** (1 day) - granted parole, return to being a citizen.

### 4. Space Opening

You wake in a high-tech ship orbiting an asteroid - it's a mining ship, and you're the only one on board. You can't escape, but after a while, a replacement clone of you appears, and you talk.

**Discovery:**
From the on-board AI: only one clone can be active at a time, and you are not one of them.

**Resolution:**
Fight the other clone to the death:
- **If you lose:** Clone is merciful, shoots you out escape pod toward nearest planet
- **If you win:** Find controls to the docking ship on the mining base, can leave to explore the galaxy

## World Events

- Circular room with walls sloping away from congregation
- Members speak from boxes in turns, amplified over the whole place

**Karl Zeliphon's Speech:**
*"We need to keep funding the Imperial Navy, and not take away from it to support refugees of the war. Yes, their conditions are not ideal, and disease is rife; however, we simply cannot cut funding from the Navy. The Navy is paramount. The Navy is keeping us from harm... It would not be moral, let alone logical, to detract from this marvellous ensemble of the bravest the Federation can muster.*

*I instead propose we raise a refugee reform levy from those companies which are not actively contributing to the war effort, those companies which strive only to profit from this war time economy..."*

**Opposition Response:**
*"If I were in power, this shambles of a Navy which cannot do anything but slow the onslaught of Pryzct, would be in top shape to defend, and counter attack to win back our homes, and purge this scum from the universe..."*

After some back and forth, they convene for the day.
