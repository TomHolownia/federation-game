## Major Planets

### 1. Ilreine

A water world covered in a three kilometer (or more) deep ocean.

**Environment:**
- Always raining due to an absurd quirk of nature

- Oceans are teeming with life due to warm waters
- Many dangerous predators
- Dark shapes detected by radar measuring 100 meters long
- Known to eat small boats and occasionally attack larger ones

**Economy:**
Very valuable chemical **Palinium** found in volcanoes. Many companies brave the terrors of the Ilreine deep to get at it.

### 3. Callarando

Huge industrial planet - outputs around 15% of the Federation's total power and is responsible for thousands of factories.

**Homeland:** Zaggnor aliens

**History:**
Found only 200 years ago. There was much debate whether it should be left alone as the Zaggnor had not discovered FTL and were only beginning to spread throughout their solar system. However, they were at each other's throats with nuclear weapons and overpopulated, so they joined the Federation.

**Culture:**
The Zaggnor are hardworking aliens, so their home world has become a hub of productivity and industry. After joining the Federation, they calmed down hugely as they were no longer at each other's throats. However, they harbor contempt for humans, seeing them as scum and indecent.

**Notable Company: ZX-Industries**
One of the only human companies to make it on Callarando - Zenith Xenos Weapons Industries. They design powerful hardware for military, police and government use. They also finance themselves running an underground criminal organization called **DarkTech** who will steal, intimidate or kill for pay. ZX-Industries designs weapons for the Imperial Navy, so their agents are usually equipped with high tech weaponry and gadgets. DarkTech also has a strong presence on Korg.

**Description:**
- Masterfully crafted, but from another galaxy
- One large major city that encompasses the entire tube
- Home ship of the mysterious Hellir, who have no memories of where they came from
- Called "New Hellir" because the Hellir remember that Hellir was the name of their home planet

**Kynias Station:**
The only constant wormhole generator in the entire commonwealth, powered by 30 fusion reactors. Links to New Mars, Marrakech, Gorgon and Callarando - acts as a junction for transports crossing between these planets. Incredibly busy at all times and carefully watched by the Imperial Navy for terrorist activity.

**Resources:**
Supplies the Federation with huge amount of pure tritium and deuterium (essential for fusion reactors) which resides on the planet's surface in oceans. The strange solar flare caused a reaction that changed water to tritium and deuterium before evaporating.

### 24. Angelus

Site of the most vicious conflicts of the Pryzct war.

**History:**
Pryzct forcefully took control and destroyed Chiascura infrastructure. Nuclear explosions and exotic weaponry used above the skies and on the surface, all but destroying it. After weeks of fighting allowing civilian escape, the planet was lost. Later, 10 Imperial Assassins destroyed several Queens and huge amounts of infrastructure in a daring raid, allowing the Navy to reclaim it. Currently under renewed attack with 30 wormholes opened.

**Current Status:**
- Federation has 1 large bunker under constant attack
- Thousands of Pryzct assault daily
- Force fields powered by wormhole links to Magnus

**Sites:**
- Drop Zone-1 - Pryzct Fortress (Medium)

---

### 27. Altmara

A Chiascura fringe world established before humans joined the Federation.

**History:**

- Trillions of asteroids
- Quantum space-time fluctuations
- Stars may implode, be torn apart, or supernova for no apparent reason

**Origin:**
Unknown - believed to be Octan weapons testing area. Cuts off Gorgon/Callarando and Ilreine/Kynias, so travel must go around it.

**Travel:**
- Only ~1/10 normal speed even with warp drive
- Random wormholes appear to different parts of the gulf
- Random nuclear mines and quantum distortions
- Millions of randomly generated asteroids

**Asteroid Village:**
A crew of ~200 Hellir got trapped in the Warp Gulf and formed a town inside a colossal asteroid. The asteroid contains water; they've sealed it and planted plants creating a pressurized atmosphere. Spins for gravity (like New Hellir), protected by extreme forcefields.
