## Playable Races

### 1. Humans

The second largest population in the Federation and widely regarded as scum and traitors. They accepted the terms of the five-race union however, and became part of the Federation.

**Cultural Influence:**
Despite being disliked, humans are extremely influential in culture:
- **Religion:** Wisdomism, a variant of Christianity, is basically the only religion left in the Federation with billions of followers
- **Music:** Human music is widely regarded as the best (along with Chiascura)
- **Language:** Members of the Federation speak Humananian language, a variant of English. This was adopted when the Chiascura first met the humans and joined to make the Federation

**Skills:**
| Technical | Weaponry | Stealth | Language |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| 10 | 20 | 5 | 25 |

### 4. Hellir

The final aliens, found on the intergalactic ship/city New Hellir, which is now parked in orbit around a star and serves as one of the Federation's finest cities.

**Physical Characteristics:**
- Head at the front

- Least populous of the five nations (~100 million)
- Do not appear to mate or reproduce in any way

**Mystery:**
New Hellir is a remarkable feat of engineering, showing the Hellir are very powerful. It is a topic of much debate whether finding the rest of the Hellir race would be good, as they would be very powerful indeed.

**Skills:**
| Technical | Weaponry | Stealth | Language |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| 20 | 10 | 10 | 20 |

### 5. RH-Union (Robot-Human Union)

Robot AIs, sometimes hidden in Chiascura or human bodies, other times not. There are many extremist groups and even some planets that want the RH-Union eliminated.

Came into being through experimental Quantum Computing. Essentially AI in bodies.

**Name Origin:**
Stands for Robot-Human Union because the Humans show some compassion for them.

- Better vehicle piloting with more agility

### Weaponry
Dictates how you fare in battle. Higher skill gives:
- Faster reload times
- Reduced weapon sway

### Stealth
Dictates how stealthy you are to detect. While in combat mode:
