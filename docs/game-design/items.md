## Armor & Clothing

Armors have aesthetic appeal and protective elements. Most will only stop a few shots before the user is killed - the force field is where most damage is stopped.

### Armor Types

| **Light Hydraulic Titanium** | Hydraulic assist for greater movement speed, jump height and strength. Thick titanium plating. Uses lots of energy. Restricts movement (slows reticule sensitivity, limits view range) |
| **Heavy Hydraulic Diamond Titanium** | Even thicker titanium with diamond coating. Uses incredible energy. Restricts movement |
| **Zaggnor Armour** | Hardened metallic, fits well on Zaggnors, deflects plasma and energy weapons well |
| **Human Armour** | Regenerative skin and artificial muscle. Good against flames, energy and plasma, not kinetic |
| **Stealth Suit** | Makes user slightly invisible, enhanced by stealth shield, battery and amplifier. Uses fair energy |
| **Stealth Armour** | Slightly invisible (less than suit), greater kinetic protection, decreases energy use |

### Exosuits

Exosuits enhance performance by allowing slots for batteries and shields, and increase personal carry weight. Unlike armor (which you buy in different pieces), an exosuit is one piece with different life support functions. Armor goes over your exosuit.

## Biomorphs

Biomorphs are body modifications that provide effects or bonuses. They are equipped in the three yellow biomorph slots in the equipment tab.

---

## Consumables

### Food & Drink

Your character will start saying things when getting hungry like "Hmm, I wonder where I could grab some food?" or "God, I'm hungry."

- Need about **two meals per day** or stamina drops significantly, eventually losing health
- Need about **one drink per day**
- **Robots** do not suffer from hunger/thirst (inbuilt solar cells)

When you activate food/drink from inventory, you start eating/drinking (uses one hand). Hunger replenishes immediately, stamina and health regenerate faster. Food/drink eventually finishes.

### Alcohol

When drinking too much:
- Vision slowly goes fuzzy
- Stumble progressively more
- Aiming weapons becomes harder
- Cannot talk to people as well
- Eventually pass out, wake somewhere close to where you had your last drink

### Drugs

Multiple types of illicit substances, most available on Korg.

**Salmar** (Zaggnor drug): Causes hallucinations, screen filters/colors change, things jump around vision, blurry. Eventually pass out.

Drugs take effect ~10 mins after being taken.

**Note:** Hellir are unaffected by alcohol, Salmar and other drugs.

**Quest:** Drinking competition, drug competition - can only be won if you are a Hellir.

### Combat Drugs

Temporary effects:
- Speed boost
- Strength boost
- Temporary health boost
