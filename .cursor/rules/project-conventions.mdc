# Federation Game - Project Conventions

## Project Overview
Federation Game is a 3D galaxy simulator built with Unreal Engine 5, designed to eventually support large-scale space and ground battles.

## Before Making Changes

1. **Read AGENTS.md** - Contains the complete workflow for AI agents
2. **Check the task board** - Tasks are in Atlassian (Jira/Confluence); use the Atlassian MCP server in Cursor (see `.cursor/mcp.json.example`) or Atlassian APIs. Do not commit secrets.
3. **Verify your worktree/branch** - Never work directly on main. Create and use worktrees in the **`.worktrees/`** directory (see AGENTS.md).

## Documentation and scripts

- **Do not create new .md (or other doc) files** unless a human explicitly asks for them. Prefer updating existing docs (e.g. AGENTS.md, README) or in-code comments.
- **Do not add Python (or other one-off) scripts** unless there is absolutely no other option (e.g. existing tooling, shell, or editor features can’t do it). Prefer existing project tooling or simple commands.

## Code Style

### C++ Conventions (UE5)
- Follow Unreal Engine coding standards
- Use `UPROPERTY()` and `UFUNCTION()` macros appropriately
- Prefix classes: `A` for Actors, `U` for UObjects, `F` for structs, `E` for enums
- Use PascalCase for types and functions, camelCase for variables
- Always include header guards or `#pragma once`

### Blueprint Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Add comments to complex logic
- Keep Blueprint graphs organized with Reroute Nodes and Comments
- Prefer functions over complex macro graphs

## File Organization

```

│   └── Tests/         # Unit tests
```

## Testing Requirements

- **All new C++ code must have unit tests**
- Tests go in `Source/FederationGame/Tests/`
- Use UE5 Automation Testing framework
- Test file naming: `Test_<ClassName>.cpp`

## Commit Guidelines

- Reference task ID: `[FED-XXX] Description`
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Performance Considerations

- This game will handle galaxy-scale data (100,000+ stars)
- Always consider performance implications
- Use instancing for repeated geometry
- Leverage Level Streaming and World Partition
- Profile before optimizing
