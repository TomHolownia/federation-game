# Federation Game - Project Conventions

## Project Overview
Federation Game is a 3D galaxy simulator built with Unreal Engine 5, designed to eventually support large-scale space and ground battles.

## Before Making Changes

1. **Read AGENTS.md** - Contains the complete workflow for AI agents
2. **Check TODO.md** - The task board for tracking work
3. **Verify your worktree/branch** - Never work directly on main

## Code Style

### C++ Conventions (UE5)
- Follow Unreal Engine coding standards
- Use `UPROPERTY()` and `UFUNCTION()` macros appropriately
- Prefix classes: `A` for Actors, `U` for UObjects, `F` for structs, `E` for enums
- Use PascalCase for types and functions, camelCase for variables
- Always include header guards or `#pragma once`

### Blueprint Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Add comments to complex logic
- Keep Blueprint graphs organized with Reroute Nodes and Comments
- Prefer functions over complex macro graphs

## File Organization

```
Content/
├── Core/              # Shared utilities, base classes
├── Galaxy/            # Galaxy-level systems
├── SolarSystem/       # Solar system scale
├── Planet/            # Planetary systems
├── UI/                # User interface assets
├── Characters/        # Player and NPC characters
├── Vehicles/          # Ships, ground vehicles
└── Audio/             # Sound effects, music

```

## Testing Requirements

- **All new C++ code must have unit tests**
- Tests go in `Source/FederationGame/Tests/`
- Use UE5 Automation Testing framework
- Test file naming: `Test_<ClassName>.cpp`

## Commit Guidelines

- Reference task ID: `[FED-XXX] Description`
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Performance Considerations

- This game will handle galaxy-scale data (100,000+ stars)
- Always consider performance implications
- Use instancing for repeated geometry
- Leverage Level Streaming and World Partition
- Profile before optimizing
