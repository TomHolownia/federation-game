# Agent Workflow - MUST Follow

## BEFORE ANY WORK - Do These Steps IN ORDER

### Step 1: Get the Task Board from Notion
- The task board lives in **Notion** (Federation Homepage wiki), not in a file.
- Use the **Notion API** to fetch the Task Board page and read tasks. See **docs/technical/notion-todo.md** for endpoints and the Task Board page ID.
- **Authentication:** Use `NOTION_INTEGRATION_SECRET` from the environment. Never commit this value; it must be injected (e.g. by the user or CI).
- Pick a task from the **Ready** section. Understand acceptance criteria before proceeding.

### Step 2: Create a NEW Worktree and Branch
```bash
# From the main repo directory, create worktree from main
git worktree add ../federation-game-FED-XXX -b feature/FED-XXX-description origin/main

# Work in the new worktree
cd ../federation-game-FED-XXX
```

### Step 3: Work in the Worktree
- **Operate from the worktree:** Run all terminal commands from the worktree directory (`cd ../federation-game-FED-XXX`). Make all file edits in the worktree (use the worktree path, not the main repo). This keeps changes on the feature branch and avoids editing main.
- Commit frequently with format: `[FED-XXX] Description`
- Update the task to **In Progress** in the Notion task board (via API; see docs/technical/notion-todo.md)

### Step 4: Push and Create PR
```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "[FED-XXX] Description" --body "Summary and test plan"
```

### When Finishing Work (after creating a PR)
- **Always give the user the PR as a clickable markdown link**, e.g. `[PR #11](https://github.com/.../pull/11)`, so they can open it directly in Cursor.

## NEVER Do These Things
- NEVER push directly to main - branch protection requires PRs
- NEVER commit to an existing branch without explicit instruction
- NEVER work in the main repo directory - use worktrees
- NEVER skip creating a branch for a new task
- NEVER force push to any protected branch
- NEVER merge your own PR without approval (when CI is set up)

See `AGENTS.md` for detailed workflow, best practices, and command reference.
